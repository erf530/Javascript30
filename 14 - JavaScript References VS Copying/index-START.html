    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    // team[3] = 'lux'
    //bc we update the original array, will always reference back

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'pop'

    //using Array.from
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[3] = 'ok'


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    // captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 })
    console.log(cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = { ...person, dog: 'archie' }
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: '@wesbos'
      }
    };
    //object.assign only does ONE level deep, need clone deep to get next level

    //another option, take JSON that returns a string then parse back to an object to get full copy. No idea about performance. "Poor mans deep clone"
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))

    const dev = { ...wes }
